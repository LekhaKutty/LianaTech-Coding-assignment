I have used HTML,CSS, JS,Jquery and Bootstrap 3. 
I have used Jquerry for number animation. 
JS was used for  subscribe button and thank you response.
I have tried  to fetch news from the RSS feed that you have shared, but it was not successful. This has been a challenge.
I have created two HTML pages - index.html and news.html, two CSS files - main.css and parallax.css, and one JS file - main.js. 
Parallax is in the news.html. From home page you can go to news page by clicking More News under Latest News.
